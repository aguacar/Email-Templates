Hi Nathan,

Thank you for your interest in volunteering to be one of our student leaders (TAs)! 

CodePath.org mission is to eliminate educational inequity in technical education starting with college C.S. education. Your participation will make a huge role in making it happen.

To confirm your participation, kindly fill-out this [survey form](https://tinyurl.com/ybgj6qzw) and **submit to us on or before June 10, Pacific Time**. The information you will be provided will enable us to know more about you and create a good match for your assigned group.

As an overview, we have 3 [Interview prep courses](https://codepath.org/classes/interviewprep) listed below together with their requirements to help you decide on what course you are interested in.
* [Beginner](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_software_eng/overview)
* [Intermediate](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intermediate_software_eng/overview) 
* [Advanced](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/advanced_software_eng/overview)

Each TA will be placed in a group of 5 students for the 12-week program that meets remotely twice a week.

In case you prefer to [volunteer in other ways](https://codepath.org/volunteer), we are also looking for individuals who can lead workshops, co-host events, curriculum developers, teaching assistants, and more.
