Hi Nathan,

Thank you for your interest in volunteering to be one of our student leaders (TAs)! 

CodePath.org mission is to eliminate educational inequity in technical education starting with college C.S. education. Your participation will make a huge role in making it happen.

To confirm your participation, kindly fill-out this [survey form](https://tinyurl.com/ybgj6qzw) and **submit to us on or before June 10, Pacific Time**. The information you will be provided will enable us to know more about you and create a good match for your assigned group.

As an overview, we have 3 [Interview prep courses](https://codepath.org/classes/interviewprep) listed below together with their requirements to help you decide on what course you are interested in.
* [Beginner](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_software_eng/overview)
* [Intermediate](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intermediate_software_eng/overview) 
* [Advanced](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/advanced_software_eng/overview)

Each TA will be placed in a group of 5 students for the 12-week program that meets remotely twice a week.

In case you prefer to [volunteer in other ways](https://codepath.org/volunteer), we are also looking for individuals who can lead workshops, co-host events, curriculum developers, teaching assistants, and more.

If you have questions, feel free to reply back in this email.

We are excited to have you and we hope to hear from you soon.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team

Hi Michael,

Thank you for your interest in our [Interview prep courses](https://codepath.org/classes/interviewprep) at Codepath.org. We regret to inform you that we cannot offer our courses because the admission is closed and class is full. 

We run the courses every summer and during this time we receive a large number of applications worldwide and we already have a long waitlist.

We invite you to apply again to our courses next year and we recommend applying as early as possible. You can use this [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) containing tips and guidelines that you might find helpful. We encourage you to visit our [page](https://codepath.org/classes#) to learn more and [sign up](https://codepath.org/classes#) for our mailing list to keep you updated on our latest announcements.

We wish you all the best in your future studies and look forward to hearing from you again next year.

Warm wishes,
